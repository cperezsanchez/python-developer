### What are we looking for? What does this prove?
* Assumptions you make given limited requirements
* We are going to value the quality of code before quantity.
* Identify areas of your strengths.
* This is not a pass or fail test, this will serve as a common ground that we can deep dive together into specific issues
* Write code as if you are writing code in a team for a production app. Treat it as if you are releasing it to the public
* Finally, we take pride in the code we write so ensure that your code is well encapsulated and follows a consistent convention
